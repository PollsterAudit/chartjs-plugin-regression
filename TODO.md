## TODO
A simple todo list for the project

- Support Animations
- Support all visual options *(E.x. lineStyle, width, color gradients, hover\*, border\*, labels, etc...)*
- Trendline Confidence Interval Ribbons *(Like you would with [R's geom_ribbon](https://tidyverse.github.io/ggplot2-docs/reference/geom_ribbon.html))*
- Support Fill above/below
- Support for vertical lines charts
- Support Decimation *(We probably want to change if it's applied before or after)*
